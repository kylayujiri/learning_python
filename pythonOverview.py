# PYTHON
# This document serves as a cheat sheet for what I've learned in Python.

# This is how comments are written.

# Primarily uses lower_case for variable names
# Does not use brackets or semi-colons

# Is dynamically typed (do not need to state variable types; the type of data an object can store is mutable)

# Primitives
my_integer = 5
my_float = 5.0
my_string = "5"
my_bool = True #true and false are capitalized

# More on Strings
my_str = "Hi"
my_str2 = "Kyla"
my_str3 = my_str + " " + my_str2 # "Hi Kyla"

make_nanana = "na" * 3 # Results in "nanana"

# Slicing Strings
orig_str = "Hello, world"
sliced_str = orig_str[2:] # "llo, world"
sliced_str2 = orig_str[0] + orig_str[11] # "Hd"

# Multi Line Strings
my_MLS = """ Hi!
This is my Multi Line String (MLS)."""

# Lists

# Operators
my_sum = 5 + 5
my_difference = 5 - 5
my_product = 5 * 5
my_quotient = 5 / 5
my_power = 5 ** 5 # This is 5^5
my_modulo = 5 % 5

# Printing
print("Hello, world")
